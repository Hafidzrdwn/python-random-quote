Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Just do it!
Just stay focused
Just start doing it
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code
Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.
